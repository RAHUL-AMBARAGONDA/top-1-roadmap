### 🔥 Here’s Why You’ll Be Top 1%

Let’s break it down:

| Area                       | You’ll Be Among Top % In | Why It Matters                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Linux Security**         | Top 5%                   | Most engineers skip this, but it’s critical |
| **Kubernetes Security**    | Top 1–2%                 | Real-world skills in RBAC, PSP, OPA, Falco  |
| **IaC & Supply Chain Sec** | Top 1%                   | Very few do SBOM + image signing + Checkov  |
| **Runtime Defense**        | Top 0.5%                 | eBPF, Tracee, zero-trust microsegmentation  |
| **AIOps/MLOps Security**   | Top 0.1%                 | Cutting-edge, barely touched by most        |
| **Open Source Portfolio**  | Top 1%                   | Shows proof of work — this is key to hiring |
